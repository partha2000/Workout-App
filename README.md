# GYM WORKOUT COMPANION APP

This app was created in response to the challenge video posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFrKjhcTAzE">Hitesh Choudhary's</a> youtube channel for app developers ðŸ“±.

It has all the basic features asked for, like a random mode and a daily mode. The random mode selects 5 workouts in the background. All you have to do is select the number of repetitions ðŸ’ª. The daily mode works the same but the number of repetitions can not be altered.
On completing the daily set, it will get added to the database and one can monitor his/her progress from the ðŸ“ˆstats section.
Each workout also has a definite amount of rest time in between. Each workout has a piece of different music attached which will serve as a auditory marker to differentiate between.
